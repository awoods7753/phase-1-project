# Phase 1 Project - Peaky Blinders Fan Page
This repository is a project for Flatiron school phase 1. It is a Peaky Blinders (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)) fan page created using what we have learned in the course so far to include HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Data for the website will be stored in a db.JSON file using a JSON server.

The idea of this project came from my personal enjoyment from the TV series, in lue of the upcoming and final season.

The interactivity of this website will include the ability to press the right or left arrow on the directional pad to scroll through a list of 5 Peaky Blinders characters totaling 10 characters. These characters will have a picture, with name and some basic info attached. There will be a vote button where fans of Peaky Blinders can vote for their favorite character and the amount of votes will update. The bottom left of the website will have an interactive pie chart that automatically updates the character's votes, and the bottom right of the website will have a playable video trailer of the TV series. Between the pie chart and the video trailer will be a form where you can submit an additional character that should be added to the fan page with a reason why, that produces an alert that your submission will be considered!

In this project I will use images from a Peaky Blinders fandom website - credit to https://peaky-blinders.fandom.com/wiki/. I will also use an official Peaky Blinders TV series trailer for season 6 from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nsT9uQPIrk, credit to BBC.

As this is a school project, no contributions will be accepted for the fan page, though I appreciate the thought in advance. For any support please contact awoods7753@gmail.com.

Enjoy!
